        <h3>RISC-V CPU &emsp; <a href="https://github.com/NachtSpyder04/RISC-V-Eklavya-23" class="icon fa-github"><span class="label">Github</span></a></h3>
            <p>Designed a RISC-V core supporting RV32IM extensions in Verilog HDL from scratch. This CPU was tested on UPduino 3.0 board using Yosys suite and IceStorm toolchain by successfully executing a fibonacci series by connecting output GPIOs to a Seven Segment Display.</p>

        <h3>E-yantra - Astro-Tinker Robot &emsp; <a href="https://github.com/RapidRoger18/E-yantra_Astrotinker-bot" class="icon fa-github"><span class="label">Github</span></a></h3>
            <p> Constructed a Pick and Place and Line Following robot to use in an arena that represents an scenario of a space station with a team of four and implemented a single cycle RISC-V RV32I core, written in Verilog HDL that can execute C codes, compiled into hexadecimal instructions for the CPU using the RISC-V cross-compiler. We executed a Dijkstra's Algorithm written in C on the RISC-V CPU to find the shortest path between two locations in the arena and navigation was achieved by a Line following Algorithm, implementing a PID controller for the same.This was programmed on the DE0-Nano development board consisting of Intel Cyclone-IV FPGA with the help of Intel Quartus Prime Lite and Modelsim Altera </p>

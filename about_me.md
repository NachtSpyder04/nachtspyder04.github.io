<p> Hello, I am Saish Karole, currently pursuing B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) in Electronics Engineering at Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai. For me, going into college was like throwing a fish, who only knew his fish bowl, into a vast ocean of domains I could explore and number of opportunities they can lead too. However, I swam towards the domains that I was intersted in exploring i.e; Computer Architecture and FPGA programming </p>

<p> In abstract terms, Hardware and Software is needed for a computer to function a given task. Computer Architecture is the design of the implementation layers that will allow to execute information coming from the software effciently using the given hardware. I find this domain very important and think that it will play a bigger role in the upcoming future as both Hardware and software advancements will force the growth of available architectures </p>

<p> FPGA or Field Programmable Gate Arrays is a type of configurable integrated circuit that can be repeatedly programmed after manufacturing. They're referred to as 'field programmable' because they provide users the ability to reconfigure the hardware to meet specific use case requirements after the manufacturing process. We can test our designs on FPGA fabric by programming it using a Hardware Descriptive Language (HDL). One can say we can test our design using a Microcontroller. Yes, we can but a Microcontroller is customizable on a superficial level, having a fixed hardware structure and low processing power.
Meanwhile FPGAs are ideal for complex operations that require more processing power and allows us to customize it on a lower level which makes it suitable for testing a CPU design </p>

<p> I am an avid learner and have done some projects related to my interests under the guidance of my seniors who introduced me to these domains, feel free to check it out. I am always open to any opportunities in Computer Architecture and RTL Design & Verification. Feel free to connect with me if you would like to discuss any ideas or any of my previous work. </p>

<p>I also like to play video games, table tennis and watch movies in free time.</p>
